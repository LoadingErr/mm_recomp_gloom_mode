# mm_recomp_gloom_mode
This mod adds Gloom Mode to Majora's Mask: Recompiled!

- Damage values are unaffected
- Dying removes a heart permanently (you can still gain hearts as normal)
- Double Defense essentially doubles your heart count, and gaining a new heart will also make it a Defense Heart
- Losing all your hearts will cause the Moon to crash and reset you to the beginning of your cycle

RECOMMENDED: Delete your save file upon getting a moon crash >:) 
(this will likely be added as a config option in the future)
